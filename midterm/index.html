<h2 style="color:rgb(10, 14, 31)">.</h2>
<h2 id="textcolor" class="textsize">Ursa Major and Ursa Minor</h2>
<p id="textcolor">Zeus fell in love with a mortal woman, Callisto, and had a child named Arctos. Hera, Zeus' wife, found out and got mad. Zeus turned Callisto into a bear and sent her away to protect from Hera's wrath. Arctos turned into a great hunter as he grew up. One day, as he was hunting he was about to shoot a bear. But this bear was his mother. Zeus saw this and appeared down on Earth to stop Arctos. Hera saw this and saw an oppurtunity to kill Callisto. She appeared down as well. Zeus was scared and turned Arctos into a bear as well. He grabbed both their tails and spun really fast and threw them into the air. Ursa Major and Ursa Minor are the tail and hindquarters of the bear and the full bear constellation is usually unable to be seen.</p>
<h2 id="textcolor" class="textsize">Lyra</h2>
<p id="textcolor">Orpheus, a gifted harp player, fell in love with a waman named Eurydice. They were in love and happily married. This love was short-lived though as Eurydice soon died from a snake bite. Orpheus was overcome with grief and traveled to the underworld to plead to Hades for Eurydice's return. Hades agreed but only under specific conditions: As Orpheus walks back up to the overworld, he must constantly play his harp, and not look back. For many days he climbed back up, playing his harp until his fingers bloodied. At the very end, Eurydice's footsteps stopped behind him. Worried, he turned back and saw Eurydice getting pulled back into the underworld. Heartbroken, Orpheus decided to never play his harp again and laid it down. Zeus then put it up into the sky as the constellation Lyra to honor his music and tragic love. </p>
<h2 id="textcolor" class="textsize">Cygnus</h2>
<p id="textcolor">Phaethon, the son of Helios, stole Helios' chariot and tried to drive the sun. He could not control it and raced through the sky, scorching the Earth. This is where the Sahara dessert originated from. Zeus, sensing this chaos, had to throw a lightning bolt to kill Phaethon before he destroyed the Earth. Phaethon crashed and died in the river, Eridanus. Cygnus, Phaethon's close friend was devastated and dove into the river to save Phaethon. Zeus transformed Cygnus into a swan so he could dive deeper. After retriving Phaethon's body, Cygnus cried and mourned his death. To honor his act of service, Zeus placed him up into the night sky in swan form.</p>
<h2 id="textcolor" class="textsize">Cassiopeia</h2>
<p id="textcolor">A beautiful woman named Cassiopeia was bragging about her beauty one day. In a temple of Hera, she said "I am more beautiful than Hera." Hera heard this and appeared on Earth. She decided to punish Cassiopeia, first by offering her daughter, Andromeda as a sacrifice to a sea monster, and two, placing Cassiopeia in the sky, half the year on her throne, half head bowed down in shame as the constellation "Cassiopeia." </p>
<h2 id="textcolor" class="textsize">Gemini</h2>
<p id="textcolor">There were 2 twins, Castor and Pollux. They were born of an egg with 2 different fathers. Castor was mortal and Pollux, immortal. They fought together in war constantly until Castor died in war. Pollux, depressed, went to the gods to appeal to them to bring Castor back from the dead. They decided that they could split Castor's immortality between them and spend half their days in the Underworld, and half up on Mount Olympus. To honor the brothers' love and devotion, they were put into the sky together as Gemini.</p>
